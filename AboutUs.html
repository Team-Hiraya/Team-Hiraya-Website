            <p>We are a small indie team driven by imagination and purpose, creating games, animation, art, and more.
                Rooted in the meaning of "Hiraya" â€” "the fruit of one's hopes, dreams, and aspirations" our work reflects a balance of vision, discipline, and respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hiraya represents the pursuit of dreams through creativity and dedication. It reminds us that with passion and effort, we can turn our aspirations into reality.
                Every project that we create is a piece of that shared vision crafted with heart, curiosity, and a deep love for storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                                We may be small, but our ambitions reach far. With every frame, note, and line of code, we move close to turning imagination into something real.
